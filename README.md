# Engineering 4 Notebook

This is where all my stuff will go!

## Hello Python

### Lessons Learned

This lesson showed me how much formatting mattered in Python. A single space messed up my code and took me half a class period to find. Also, It's important to know what version of Python you're using. in other versions, a keyboard input prompt gets called "raw.input()" whereas in the version I had was called "input()"

## Python Calculator

### Lessons Learned

Combining strings and variables happens with commas, not plus symbols. Functions are declared with "def". Inputs will be strings unless converted into something else. I discoverd that when the error only occured at the subrtracting equation.

## Python Quadratic Solver

### Lessons Learned

When you edit a file, you have to re-add it to git or it won't commit.

## Strings and Loops

### Lessons Learned

The key to figuring out this assignment is that when the sentence is split, the assigned variable becomes a list. In the list, each word has a set place that can be found using [numbers]. Then, each word within that list is a string, the characters in which can also be found with [numers]. A cool thing I found is that these [numbers] can be stacked[][].

## Pinata Shaped Man

### Lessons Learned

Dr. Shields' advice is sound: take small bites. This assignment was pretty complex so it helped to just go layer by layer and do lots of small tests. Another thing that was helpful was to use an array to store the user's current guesses, then attach the characters in the array into a string before printing them.

## GPIO Bash

### Lessons Learned

The first step of this assignment was to solder male-male headers onto the pi. This gave me the most amount of trouble, as I had plugged the header into a breadboard to secure it. When I tried to heat up the pins enough to melt solder onto it, it never got hot enough. As it turns out, the breadboard was absorbing heat from the pins. As soon as I took it out of the breadboard, the solder melted on perfectly. As for the code, I had forgotten that bash is a lot less straightforward than python. I couldn't get a for loop to work, so I had to make a makeshift for loop using "until". I also found a useful docement online showing which pins on the cobler corresponded to which gpio in the code.
