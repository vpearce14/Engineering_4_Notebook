This is where all my stuff will go!

## Hello Python

###Lessons Learned

This lesson showed me how much formatting mattered in Python. A single space messed up my code and took me half a class period to find. Also, It's important to know what version of Python you're using. in other versions, a keyboard input prompt gets called "raw.input()" whereas in the version I had was called "input()"

## Python Calculator

###Lessons Learned

Combining strings and variables happens with commas, not plus symbols. Functions are declared with "def". Inputs will be strings unless converted into something else. I discoverd that when the error only occured at the subrtracting equation.

## Python Quadratic Solver

###Lessons Learned

When you edit a file, you have to re-add it to git or it won't commit.
