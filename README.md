This is where all my stuff will go!

## Hello Python

### Lessons Learned

This lesson showed me how much formatting mattered in Python. A single space messed up my code and took me half a class period to find. Also, It's important to know what version of Python you're using. in other versions, a keyboard input prompt gets called "raw.input()" whereas in the version I had was called "input()"

## Python Calculator

### Lessons Learned

Combining strings and variables happens with commas, not plus symbols. Functions are declared with "def". Inputs will be strings unless converted into something else. I discoverd that when the error only occured at the subrtracting equation.

## Python Quadratic Solver

### Lessons Learned

When you edit a file, you have to re-add it to git or it won't commit.

## Strings and Loops

### Lessons Learned

The key to figuring out this assignment is that when the sentence is split, the assigned variable becomes a list. In the list, each word has a set place that can be found using [numbers]. Then, each word within that list is a string, the characters in which can also be found with [numers]. A cool thing I found is that these [numbers] can be stacked[][].

## Pinata Shaped Man

### Lessons Learned

Dr. Shields' advice is sound: take small bites. This assignment was pretty complex so it helped to just go layer by layer and do lots of small tests.
